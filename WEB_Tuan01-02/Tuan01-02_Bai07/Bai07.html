    <span>A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth. Some smiles
        include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the eyes, an action known as a Duchenne smile. Among
        humans, a smile expresses delight, sociability, happiness, joy, or amusement. It is distinct from a similar but
        usually involuntary expression of anxiety known as a grimace. Although cross-cultural studies have shown that
        smiling is a means of communication throughout the world,[1] there are large differences among different
        cultures, religions, and societies, with some using smiles to convey confusion or embarrassment.</span>
